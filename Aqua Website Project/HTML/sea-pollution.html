                <p>Chemical contamination, or nutrient pollution, is concerning for health, environmental, and economic
                    reasons. This type of pollution occurs when human activities, notably the use of fertilizer on
                    farms, lead to the runoff of chemicals into waterways that ultimately flow into the ocean. The
                    increased concentration of chemicals, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, in the coastal ocean promotes
                    the growth of algal blooms, which can be toxic to wildlife and harmful to humans. The negative
                    effects on health and the environment caused by algal blooms hurt local fishing and tourism
                    industries.</p>

                <p>Solutions for marine pollution include prevention and cleanup. Disposable and single-use plastic is
                    abundantly used in today’s society, from shopping bags to shipping packaging to plastic bottles.
                    Changing society’s approach to plastic use will be a long and economically challenging process.
                    Cleanup, in contrast, may be impossible for some items. Many types of debris (including some
                    plastics) do not float, so they are lost deep in the ocean. Plastics that do float tend to collect
                    in large “patches” in ocean gyres. The Pacific Garbage Patch is one example of such a collection,
                    with plastics and microplastics floating on and below the surface of swirling ocean currents between
                    California and Hawaii in an area of about 1.6 million square kilometers (617,763 square miles),
                    although its size is not fixed. These patches are less like islands of trash and, as the National
                    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says, more like flecks of microplastic pepper swirling around
                    an ocean soup. Even some promising solutions are inadequate for combating marine pollution.
                    So-called “biodegradable” plastics often break down only at temperatures higher than will ever be
                    reached in the ocean.</p>

                <p>Marine trash encompasses all manufactured products—most of them plastic—that end up in the ocean.
                    Littering, storm winds, and poor waste management all contribute to the accumulation of this debris,
                    80 percent of which comes from sources on land. Common types of marine debris include various
                    plastic items like shopping bags and beverage bottles, along with cigarette butts, bottle caps, food
                    wrappers, and fishing gear. Plastic waste is particularly problematic as a pollutant because it is
                    so long-lasting. Plastic items can take hundreds of years to decompose.</p>
